This file lists all the scripts in the repository, with short
descriptions. Further documentation for each script is typically
provided in the code or through the usage messages which are printed
when the scripts are run without appropriate arguments.

Directory eval
--------------

This directory contains scripts that collect statistics about
alignments or transcript reconstruction results.

calc_sim_accuracy.pl:
  Calc accuracy for alignments of simulated reads

cmp_alignment_and_cufflinks_gaps.pl:
  Compute rates for incorporation of false junctions (from alignments)
  into transcript models.

count_intronic_aln.pl:
  Count the number of alignments in introns and intronic repeats

count_mm_binned.pl:
  Calculate the distribution of number of mismatches per alignment
  stratified by mean read quality

cufflinks_eval.pl:
  Evaluate transcript reconstruction performance

gap_stats.pl:
  Collect stats about introns and other gap operation usage

get_gap_mm_pos.pl:
  Determine positional distribution of indels, introns and mismatches

Directory misc
--------------

This directory contains miscellaneous scripts.

get_gene_types_from_gtf.pl:
  From a GTF file, extract the type for each gene

Directory preproc_aln
----------------------

This directory contains scripts for preprocessing and checking
alignment files prior to running the evaluation scripts.

adapt_sam_for_sim_eval.pl:
  Adapt alignment files for evaluation by calc_sim_accuracy.pl or the
  scripts in the BEERS toolkit.

validate_bam.pl:
  Check that BAM files comply with format requirements and extract
  high-level statistics.

Directory preproc_sim
---------------------

This directory contains scripts for preprocessing simulated data prior
to running the evaluation scripts.

calc_indel_shift.pl:
  Determine placement ambiguity for each indel in a simulated transcriptome

filter_gtf_by_expr.pl
  Filter simulated transcript GTF file to exclude silent transcripts

get_junction_coverage.pl:
  Compute the read coverage for each splice junction in a set of alignments

Directory R
-----------

This directory contains R scripts that produce tables and plots,
primarily based on output from the evaluation scripts in the eval
directory. The ouput from the the quality control script
preproc_aln/validate_bam.pl is also used by some of the R scripts.

get_multi-intron_prec_recall.R:
  Get table of multi-intron precision and recall from sim accuracy stats
