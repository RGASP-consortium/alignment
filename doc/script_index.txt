This file lists all the scripts in the repository, with short
descriptions. Further documentation for each script is typically
provided in the code or through the usage messages which are printed
when the scripts are run without appropriate arguments.

Directory eval
--------------

This directory contains scripts that collect statistics about
alignments or transcript reconstruction results.

calc_sim_accuracy.pl:
  Calc accuracy for alignments of simulated reads

cmp_alignment_and_cufflinks_gaps.pl:
  Compute rates for incorporation of false junctions (from alignments)
  into transcript models.

count_intronic_aln.pl:
  Count the number of alignments in introns and intronic repeats

count_mm_binned.pl:
  Calculate the distribution of number of mismatches per alignment
  stratified by mean read quality

cufflinks_eval.pl:
  Evaluate transcript reconstruction performance

gap_stats.pl:
  Collect stats about introns and other gap operation usage

get_gap_mm_pos.pl:
  Determine positional distribution of indels, introns and mismatches

Directory misc
--------------

This directory contains miscellaneous scripts.

get_gene_types_from_gtf.pl:
  From a GTF file, extract the type for each gene

Directory preproc_aln
----------------------

This directory contains scripts for preprocessing and checking
alignment files prior to running the evaluation scripts.

adapt_sam_for_sim_eval.pl:
  Adapt alignment files for evaluation by calc_sim_accuracy.pl or the
  scripts in the BEERS toolkit.

validate_bam.pl:
  Check that BAM files comply with format requirements and extract
  high-level statistics.

Directory preproc_sim
---------------------

This directory contains scripts for preprocessing simulated data prior
to running the evaluation scripts.

calc_indel_shift.pl:
  Determine placement ambiguity for each indel in a simulated transcriptome

filter_gtf_by_expr.pl
  Filter simulated transcript GTF file to exclude silent transcripts

get_junction_coverage.pl:
  Compute the read coverage for each splice junction in a set of alignments

Directory R
-----------

This directory contains R scripts that produce tables and plots,
primarily based on output from the evaluation scripts in the eval
directory. The ouput from the the quality control script
preproc_aln/validate_bam.pl is also used by some of the R scripts.

make_alignment_vs_cufflinks_gaps_tables.R
  Tabulate frequencies at which true and false introns from alignments
  are incorporated into transcripts by Cufflinks

make_multi-intron_accuracy_tables.R:
  Get tables of multi-intron precision and recall from sim accuracy
  stats

make_pair_ali_yield_table.R
  Get table of alignment yield for read pairs

make_sim_eval_tables.R
  Make tables with fundamental simulation accuracy stats

plot_cufflinks_sim_accuracy.R
  Plot transcript reconstruction performance on simulated data, and
  make corresponding tables

plot_cufflinks_stats_primary_vs_all.R
  Make figure comparing transcript reconstruction performance using
  all vs. only primary alignments

plot_intron_known_vs_novel.R
  Plot ROC-like curve for annotated vs. novel junctions

plot_sim_indel_accuracy.R
  Plot heatmaps of indel accuracy for simulated data

plot_sim_intron_roc.R
  Plot ROC-like curve for splice junction discovery. The counts of
  true and false junctions at each threshold are also written to a
  text file.

plot_sim_read_placement_bars.R
  Plot barcharts showing accuracy of read placement

plot_sim_splice_accuracy_scatter.R
  Scatter plots of splice accuracy for simulated data

plot_sim_splice_recall_by_coverage.R
  Plot splice recall for simulated data stratified by true junction coverage

general_functions.R
  General functions used by the other R scripts

valbam_functions.R
  Functions related to BAM file validation

We are working on additing more R scripts! (Some generalization is
needed to make them usable outside of RGASP / EBI.)
